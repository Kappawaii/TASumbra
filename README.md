# TASumbra
TASumbra is a software that enables Tool Assisted Speedrun (TAS) for Penumbra : Black Plague

Any help in testing or improving the software is appreciated !

## How to use it
Note: A movie refers to a file that stores input per frame.

1. First download the latest release from the releases tab.
2. Extract it wherever you want.
3. Open the program and create a new or load an existing movie.
4. Start your penumbra game.
5. In the RunLauncher tab in TASumbra click on "Attach to game".
6. That is all, now when you start playing TASumbra uses the input defined in the currently selected movie.

- Down means the key will be activated from that frame onwards, Up means the key is released.
- Loading a save or starting a new game will reset TASumbra to frame 1.
- You have to make a different movie for every level.

## Known issues
- When you pause the game, the movie doesn't pause.

- The movie doesn't always have the same result, this is most likely due to Penumbra's physics engine not being 100% consistent.
